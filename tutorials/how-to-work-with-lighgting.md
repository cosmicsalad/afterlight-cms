Some other supplemental text could go here for added information or to explain why you chose to do something a certain way. Or something good to know inbetween steps.

From there I selected the color overlay R4 and set it to the Multiply blending mode. I set it at 100% Opacity. The reason I chose R4 for this is because of the soft golden color that it has. I also really like Multiply as a blending mode is because it gives the photos a golden tint almost over the top like a glaze.
