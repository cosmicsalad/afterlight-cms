#Hello everyone! I'm coming out of a bleak winter here in the Northwest and hoping we are headed for some warmer weather. I was inspired to create this Golden Light filter. I hope you like it!

<div class="tutorial-step">  
<div class="count">1</div>

<p>So starting off the first thing I did was go to adjustments. From there I selected Color overlay.</p>
</div>

<div class="tutorial-step">  
<div class="count">2</div>
<img src="https://afterlight.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_0121.jpeg">
<p>From there I selected the color overlay R4 and set it to the Multiply blending mode. I set it at 100% Opacity. The reason I chose R4 for this is because of the soft golden color that it has. I also really like Multiply as a blending mode is because it gives the photos a golden tint almost over the top like a glaze.</p>

<p>Next I went to the Temperature tool in Adjustments. And put it at 100. Which will add a lot more warmth to the filter. I repeated this step and extra time to get extra warmth. Depending on how warm you would like your filter this is optional. So Temperature at 100 two times.</p>

<p>Following that I went into the main filter section and chose the Fable filter at 100 percent.</p>

<p>Next I went into the curves layer to add some more dimension.</p>
</div>

<div class="tutorial-step">  
<div class="count">6</div>
<img src="https://afterlight.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_0133.jpeg">
<p>My curves layer looks like this. I placed the bottom of the curve down a bit and the top part up a tiny bit but not too much.</p>
</div>

<div class="tutorial-step">  
<div class="count">7</div>
<img src="https://afterlight.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_0136.png">
<p>And that's it! I like to save these as fusion filters so I can use on whatever opacity I like depending on the photo.</p>
</div>

##Extra

If you feel like being extra I like to layer the Tide filter at about 50% opacity over the top of this. But feel free to experiment and see what filters you like to layer with this one.

If you're going for a film look it's also fun to add some Grain or some Dust texture.

I promise that's really it this time! Have fun playing around and adding some golden sunlight sunlight to your photos. I feel like this process works best on photos where the sun might already be out just to add that extra warmth. I have posted some photos below that I have edited with this process.

Thanks for following along!
