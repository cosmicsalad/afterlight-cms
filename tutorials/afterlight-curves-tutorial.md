The Curves tool in Afterlight gives you very precise control over the tonal range of colors in your photos! Here’s a quick little guide on how it works!  
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  
When adjusting in Curves, tap to create a control point, and swipe it off to remove it. The graph is represented in three sections.

Add and move a point in the lower left area to adjust the shadows of the image, creating a nice faded look or deep contrast.

Adding a point and adjusting in the center affects the overall mid tones of the image, which is a great alternative to the brightness tool with more custom control. 

Adding a point to the upper right section represents the highlights, the bright whites.
